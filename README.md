## 🧠 Svelte 5 + Runes

This project uses **Svelte 5**, which introduces the new **runes-based reactivity model**. All contributors are expected to follow Svelte 5 conventions, especially the use of runes like `$state`, `$effect`, etc.

📖 If you're new to runes, check out the official [Svelte 5 Runes Documentation](https://svelte.dev/blog/runes) to get started.
